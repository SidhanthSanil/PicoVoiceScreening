#Voice Recon Tasks

Q1) Probability of Rain with Monte Carlo Simulation:

Implemented Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the probability of more than 'n' rainy days in a year. Added functionality to handle daily rain probabilities and output results as a percentage.

Q2) Phoneme Sequence to Word Combinations:

Developed a solution to find all word combinations matching a given sequence of phonemes using a pronunciation dictionary. Utilized recursive backtracking for efficient exploration of possible matches.

Q3) Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) Implementation:

Implemented CTC loss and gradient computation for sequence-to-sequence models. Did forward and backward prop for dp and ensured numerical stability with log-space calculations.
